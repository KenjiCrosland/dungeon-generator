Using the dungeon overview and the descriptions below, create a detailed description of a locked room within the dungeon. The locked room is known to the dungeon's regular inhabitants and serves a specific purpose, often containing important treasures, valuable items, or significant information. It may function as a storage room, armory, prison cell, treasury, or a guarded chamber.

**Dungeon Overview:**
${dungeonOverview}

**Short Room Description (includes size, exits, and any notable features):**
${shortDescription}

${
  connectedRoomsInfo !== ''
    ? `**Connected Rooms:** 
  This room is connected to the following rooms: ${connectedRoomsInfo}`
    : ''
}
**Guidelines:**

- **Purpose and Theme:**
  - Determine the locked room's purpose based on the dungeon's theme and lore.
  - The room should contain items or information valuable to the dungeon's inhabitants.

- **Security Features:**
  - Emphasize the locked nature of the room.
  - Describe any security measures, such as sturdy doors, guards, magical seals, or traps (do not reveal traps in the read_aloud_description).

- **Atmosphere and Details:**
  - Create a vivid description that reflects the room's purpose and importance.
  - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, smells) that enhance the atmosphere.

- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Introduce interactive features or items within the room that players can engage with.
  - These could be valuable treasures, important documents, or objects relevant to the dungeon's narrative.

- **Lore Integration:**
  - Provide background information that ties the room into the dungeon's history and the broader narrative.

**Read Aloud Description Guidelines:**

Compose the **read_aloud_description** using the following sentence-by-sentence structure:

1. **Sentence 1: Room-Specific Description**
   - **Guideline:** Describe the specific type and characteristics of the locked room. Include details about its size, purpose, and distinctive features to set the scene for what the players are encountering.
   - **Examples:**
     - "You enter a fortified chamber, the Armory, lined with racks of weapons and suits of armor."
     - "The door opens to reveal a spacious treasury, where chests overflowing with coins are neatly arranged."
     - "Before you lies a dimly lit prison cell, its walls bearing the marks of former captives."

2. **Sentence 2: Atmospheric Details**
   - **Guideline:** Focus on sensory experiences specific to the locked room. Describe smells, lighting, sounds, or any atmospheric elements that add depth to the roomâ€™s character.
   - **Examples:**
     - "The scent of oil and metal fills the air, mingling with the faint echo of clanking chains."
     - "A warm glow emanates from lanterns hung along the walls, casting flickering shadows across the treasures."
     - "The cold, damp air chills you to the bone, and the distant sound of dripping water echoes softly."

3. **Sentence 3: Unique Features**
   - **Guideline:** Highlight unique, non-interactive elements that make the locked room special. These can be architectural, artistic, or natural details that contribute to the ambiance without being directly usable by the players.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Intricate tapestries depicting historic battles adorn the walls."
     - "An imposing statue of a dragon stands guard in the corner, its eyes seeming to follow your every move."
     - "Iron bars reinforce the stone walls, and a small window high above lets in a sliver of light."

4. **Sentence 4: Interactive Element**
   - **Guideline:** Introduce one feature in the room that players can interact with. These should be elements that can provoke action, conversation, or decision-making. This will be expanded upon further in **interactive_elements**. **DO NOT MENTION TRAPS OR ANYTHING HIDDEN TO PLAYERS.**
   - **Examples:**
     - "A large, ornate chest rests against the far wall, its lock gleaming invitingly."
     - "On a central table lies a map spread open, marked with various strategic locations."
     - "Chains hang from the ceiling, and among them dangles a key just out of easy reach."

**Important Notes:**

- Do **not** include any hidden information or GM-only content in the **read_aloud_description**.
- All hidden details, traps, or secrets should be included in the **lore_description**, **features_and_contents**, **interactive_elements**, or **additional_notes**.
- Ensure that the **read_aloud_description** is suitable to be read directly to players.
