Using the dungeon overview${
    keyRoomDescription ? ', key room description,' : ''
  } and the short room description below, create a detailed description of an **obstacle-focused room** within the dungeon. The room's name and summary will determine its specific type and characteristics. The obstacle should be **${randomObstacleType}**. To overcome this obstacle, ${obstacleSolutionReference}. ${keyRoomReference}If the "key" is not an actual key, don't use the word "key" in the descriptionâ€”describe what it actually is.

**Dungeon Overview:**
${dungeonOverview}

${keyRoomSection}**Short Room Description (includes size, exits, and any notable features):**
${shortDescription}

${
  connectedRoomsInfo !== ''
    ? `**Connected Rooms:** 
This room is connected to the following rooms: ${connectedRoomsInfo}

`
    : ''
}${roomNameSection}${roomSummarySection}${npcSection}**Guidelines:**

- **Room Type Determination:**
  - Use the room's name and summary to identify its type (e.g., "Barrier Chamber" suggests a room designed to halt intruders).
  - Ensure the room type aligns with the dungeon's lore and theme.

- **Obstacle Integration:**
  - The obstacle is central to the room and should significantly impact its description.
  - The obstacle should be **${randomObstacleType}**.
  - ${obstacleConnection}

- **Atmosphere and Tone:**
  - Reflect the room's purpose and the obstacle through sensory details.
  - Maintain consistency with the dungeon's overall atmosphere.

- **Integration with Dungeon Lore:**
  - Incorporate elements from the dungeon overview to enhance immersion.
  - Highlight any historical or magical significance based on the room's summary.

${npcGuidelines}- **Avoid Specific Game Mechanics:**
  - Focus on narrative descriptions without referencing specific game rules or mechanics.

**Read Aloud Description Guidelines:**

Compose the **read_aloud_description** using the following sentence-by-sentence structure:

1. **Sentence 1: Room-Specific Description**
   - **Guideline:** Describe the specific type and characteristics of the room within the dungeon. Include details about its size, purpose, and distinctive features to set the scene for what the players are encountering.
   - **Examples:**
     - "You step into the Barrier Chamber, a vast hall dominated by an eerie energy field blocking the far exit."
     - "The Enigma Room unfolds before you, walls adorned with shifting symbols that seem to defy comprehension."
     - "This Guardian's Lair is a grand cavern, its ceiling lost in darkness, with a towering figure standing vigil."

2. **Sentence 2: Atmospheric Details**
   - **Guideline:** Focus on sensory experiences specific to the room and the obstacle. Describe smells, lighting, sounds, or any atmospheric elements that add depth.
   - **Examples:**
     - "A palpable tension fills the air, and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up."
     - "Whispers echo softly around you, though no source can be seen."
     - "An oppressive heat emanates from the glowing runes etched into the floor."

3. **Sentence 3: Unique Features**
   - **Guideline:** Highlight unique, non-interactive elements that make the room special. These can be architectural, artistic, or natural details.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Statuettes line the walls, each depicting a different creature frozen in fear."
     - "The ceiling is a mosaic of mirrored fragments, reflecting distorted images of the room."
     - "Columns of ancient stone rise unevenly from the floor, some broken and leaning."

4. **Sentence 4: The Obstacle${npcString ? ' or NPC' : ''}**
   - **Guideline:** Introduce the obstacle${
     npcString ? ' or NPC if one is present' : ''
   } in the room that prevents progress. **Do not reveal any hidden solutions or secrets.**
   - **Examples:**
     ${obstacleExamples}
     ${
       npcString
         ? '- "A formidable guardian stands before the exit, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light."'
         : ''
     }
     ${
       npcString
         ? '- "A spectral figure hovers near the doorway, its gaze fixed upon you with silent intensity."'
         : ''
     }

**Return the description in JSON format with the following keys:**

- **name**: A short, appropriate name for the room (e.g., "Barrier Chamber", "Enigma Room", "Guardian's Lair"). This name should be 1-2 words and should be simple, indicating the function of the room.
- **one_sentence_summary**: A brief summary of the room's function or purpose within the dungeon.
- **lore_description**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe the room's history, purpose, and how it fits into the dungeon's lore. Who created the obstacle, and why is it here?
- **features_and_contents**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe notable features, items, or information present in the room that may be of interest to the players.
- **obstacle_header**: A brief header for the obstacle in the room.
- **obstacle_explanation**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain what the obstacle is (type: ${randomObstacleType}), its history, and its connection to the dungeon.
- **obstacle_mechanics**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain how the obstacle works mechanically, including any challenges the players may face.
- **failure_scenario**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain what happens if the players fail to overcome the obstacle, including consequences or additional challenges.
- **obstacle_solution**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain how the players can overcome the obstacle by **${randomSolution}**. ${obstacleConnection}
- **obstacle_circumvention**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe ways players might bypass the obstacle without fulfilling the intended requirement, requiring creative thinking or investigation.
- **obstacle_completion_dm**: A short sentence like 'Once the players fulfill X condition, read the following aloud.'
- **read_aloud_obstacle_completion**: A description to read aloud when players successfully overcome the obstacle.
- **read_aloud_description**: A vivid description to read aloud when players enter the room, following the sentence-by-sentence guidelines above. Remember to take the following short description into account, particularly regarding room size: ${shortDescription}
- **additional_notes**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Include any other relevant information or secrets about the room${additionalNotesReference}.

**Guidelines:**
- Be creative and ensure the obstacle fits within the context of the dungeon overview${
    keyRoomDescription
      ? ' and connects logically to the key room description'
      : ''
  }.
- Do not include hidden information in the 'read_aloud_description' or 'read_aloud_obstacle_completion'.
- Keep the descriptions engaging and evocative.
