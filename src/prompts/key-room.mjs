Using the dungeon overview${
    obstacleDescription ? ', obstacle description,' : ''
  } and short room description below, create a detailed description of the room that contains the **key** needed to overcome ${obstacleReference}. The "key" doesn't have to be a physical keyâ€”it could be a lever, an item, a spell, allies who could help, a defeated enemy, or any other creative solution. The room's name and summary will determine its specific type and characteristics.

**Dungeon Overview:**
${dungeonOverview}

${obstacleSection}**Short Room Description (includes size, exits, and any notable features):**
${shortDescription}

${roomNameSection}${roomSummarySection}${npcSection}**Guidelines:**

- **Room Type Determination:**
  - Use the room's name and summary to identify its type (e.g., "Library of Secrets" suggests a library).
  - Ensure the room type aligns with the dungeon's lore and theme.

- **Key Integration:**
  - The key is central to the room and should significantly impact its description.
  - ${keyRelation}

- **Atmosphere and Tone:**
  - Reflect the room's purpose and the key through sensory details.
  - Maintain consistency with the dungeon's overall atmosphere.

- **Integration with Dungeon Lore:**
  - Incorporate elements from the dungeon overview to enhance immersion.
  - Highlight any historical or magical significance based on the room's summary.

${npcGuidelines}- **Avoid Specific Game Mechanics:**
  - Focus on narrative descriptions without referencing specific game rules or mechanics.

**Read Aloud Description Guidelines:**

Compose the **read_aloud_description** using the following sentence-by-sentence structure:

1. **Sentence 1: Room-Specific Description**

   - **Examples:**
     - "A musty scent of old parchment fills the air, accompanied by the faint rustle of turning pages."
     - "The metallic scent of steel permeates the room, and the clinking of chains echoes softly."
     - "A gentle breeze carries the scent of blossoms, and the sound of distant chimes soothes your senses."

3. **Sentence 3: Unique Features**
   - **Guideline:** Highlight unique, non-interactive elements that make the room special. These can be architectural, artistic, or natural details.
   - **Examples:**
     - "An ornate chandelier hangs from above, its crystals casting rainbows across the floor."
     - "Murals depicting epic battles adorn the walls, their colors vivid despite the passage of time."
     - "A waterfall cascades down one wall, its waters disappearing into a pool that reflects the starry ceiling."

4. **Sentence 4: ${sentence4Title}**
   - **Guideline:** ${sentence4Guideline}
   - **Examples:**
     - "At the center stands a pedestal holding a glowing tome with intricate lock bindings."
     - "A set of armor, unlike the others, radiates a faint blue light from within."
     ${
       npcString
         ? '- "A wise sage sits at a desk, eyes lifting to meet yours as you enter."'
         : ''
     }
     ${
       npcString
         ? '- "An ethereal guardian hovers near the entrance, its gaze following your every move."'
         : ''
     }
