export function generateKeyRoomPrompt(
  dungeonOverview,
  shortDescription,
  obstacleDescription,
) {
  return `
Using the dungeon overview, room description, and obstacle description below, describe a room that contains the **key** needed to overcome the obstacle in a different room. The "key" doesn't have to be a physical keyâ€”it could be a lever, an item, a spell to bypass an obstacle, allies who could help you, a defeated enemy, or any other creative solution.

**Dungeon Overview:**
${dungeonOverview}

**Obstacle Description:**
${obstacleDescription}

**Short Room Description:**
${shortDescription}
It's very important to not add any extra entrances or exits to the room. The short room description describes what's on the map.

**Return the description in JSON format with the following keys:**

- **name**: A short, evocative name for the room.
- **one_sentence_summary**: A concise summary of the room's purpose and atmosphere.
- **read_aloud_description**: A description to read aloud when players enter the room, setting the scene and describing key features without revealing hidden information.
- **key_explanation**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain what the "key" is, its history, and its connection to the obstacle and the dungeon.
- **key_location**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe where the "key" is located within the room (e.g., hidden, guarded, or in plain sight).
- **key_acquisition**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain how players can acquire the "key," including any challenges, skill checks, or combat encounters.
- **failure_consequences**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Explain what happens if players fail to acquire the "key," including any consequences or additional challenges.
- **key_circumvention**: Ways players might bypass challenges to acquire the "key" using creative thinking or alternative methods.
- **key_acquisition_dm**: A short sentence like 'Once the players acquire the key, read the following aloud.'
- **read_aloud_key_acquisition**: A description to read aloud when players successfully acquire the "key."

**Guidelines:**
- Be creative and ensure the "key" fits within the context of the dungeon overview and obstacle.
- The "key" should logically relate to the obstacle, providing a coherent narrative link.
- Do not include hidden information in the 'read_aloud_description' or 'read_aloud_key_acquisition'.
- Keep the descriptions engaging and evocative.

**Please provide the response in this JSON format.**
