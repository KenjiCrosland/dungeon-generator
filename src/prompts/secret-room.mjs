Using the dungeon overview and the descriptions below, create a detailed description of a secret room within the dungeon. The secret room is typically unknown to the dungeon's regular inhabitants and may offer a high risk/reward situation for adventurers. It often serves an exclusive purpose, such as a treasury, hidden laboratory, library of forbidden knowledge, expensive reagent storage, or a private study.

**Dungeon Overview:**
${dungeonOverview}

**Short Room Description (includes size, exits, and any notable features):**
${shortDescription}

${connectedRoomSection}**Connected Rooms:**
This room is connected to the following rooms: ${connectedRoomsInfo}

**Guidelines:**

- **Purpose and Theme:**
  - Determine the secret room's purpose based on the dungeon's theme and lore.
  - The room should offer valuable rewards, significant information, or unique challenges.

- **Exclusivity:**
  - Emphasize that the room is hidden even from the dungeon's regular inhabitants.
  - The room may be connected to a leader or significant figure within the dungeon who desires a private space.

- **Atmosphere and Details:**
  - Create a vivid description that reflects the room's secretive nature.
  - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, smells) that enhance the atmosphere.

- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Introduce interactive features or items within the room that players can engage with.
  - These could be valuable treasures, powerful artifacts, or challenging puzzles.

- **Lore Integration:**
  - Provide background information that ties the room into the dungeon's history and the broader narrative.

**Read Aloud Description Guidelines:**

Compose the **read_aloud_description** using the following sentence-by-sentence structure:

1. **Sentence 1: Room-Specific Description**
   - **Guideline:** Describe the specific type and characteristics of the secret room. Include details about its size, purpose, and distinctive features to set the scene for what the players are encountering.
   - **Examples:**
     - "You step into a dimly lit chamber, the Hidden Treasury, where piles of gold coins glint faintly in the sparse light."
     - "The concealed laboratory is cluttered with strange apparatuses and bubbling concoctions, the air thick with the scent of exotic herbs."
     - "Before you lies a forgotten library, its towering shelves filled with ancient tomes bound in worn leather."

2. **Sentence 2: Atmospheric Details**
   - **Guideline:** Focus on sensory experiences specific to the secret room. Describe smells, lighting, sounds, or any atmospheric elements that add depth to the roomâ€™s character.
   - **Examples:**
     - "A cool draft whispers through the room, carrying the faint scent of old parchment and dust."
     - "Soft, eerie glows emanate from scattered crystals, casting dancing shadows on the walls."
     - "The silence is profound, broken only by the distant dripping of water echoing through unseen passages."

3. **Sentence 3: Unique Features**
   - **Guideline:** Highlight unique, non-interactive elements that make the secret room special. These can be architectural, artistic, or natural details that contribute to the ambiance without being directly usable by the players.
   - **Examples:**
     - "Elaborate murals adorn the walls, depicting forgotten rituals and celestial events."
     - "An intricate mosaic covers the floor, its pattern forming an unknown sigil that seems to shift when not directly observed."
     - "Suspended from the ceiling is a grand chandelier, its candles long extinguished but still exuding a faint, ghostly light."

4. **Sentence 4: Interactive Element**
   - **Guideline:** Introduce one feature in the room that players can interact with. These should be elements that can provoke action, conversation, or decision-making. This will be expanded upon further in **interactive_elements**. **DO NOT MENTION TRAPS OR ANYTHING HIDDEN TO PLAYERS.**
   - **Examples:**
     - "At the center stands a pedestal holding a mysterious orb that pulsates with arcane energy."
     - "A large, ornate chest rests against the far wall, its surface engraved with ancient runes."
     - "An old lectern holds an open book, its pages filled with writings that glow softly with a silvery light."

**Important Notes:**

- Do **not** include any hidden information or GM-only content in the **read_aloud_description**.
- All hidden details, traps, or secrets should be included in the **lore_description**, **features_and_contents**, **interactive_elements**, or **additional_notes**.
- Ensure that the **read_aloud_description** is suitable to be read directly to players.
