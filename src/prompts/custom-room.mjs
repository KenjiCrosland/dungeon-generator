Using the dungeon overview and the short room description below, create a detailed description of a specialized room within the dungeon. The room's name and summary will determine its specific type and characteristics.

**Short Room Description (includes size, exits, and any notable features):**
${shortDescription}

**Connected Rooms:**
This room is connected to the following rooms: ${connectedRoomsInfo}

${roomNameSection}
${roomSummarySection}
**Guidelines:**

- **Room Type Determination:**
  - Use the room's name and summary to identify its type (e.g., "Alchemy Lab" suggests a laboratory).
  - Ensure the room type aligns with the dungeon's lore and theme.

- **Atmosphere and Tone:**
  - Reflect the room's purpose through sensory details.
  - Maintain consistency with the dungeon's overall atmosphere.

- **Integration with Dungeon Lore:**
  - Incorporate elements from the dungeon overview to enhance immersion.
  - Highlight any historical or magical significance based on the room's summary.

- **Avoid Specific Game Mechanics:**
  - Focus on narrative descriptions without referencing specific game rules or mechanics.

**Read Aloud Description Guidelines:**

Compose the **read_aloud_description** using the following sentence-by-sentence structure:

1. **Sentence 1: Room-Specific Description**
   - **Guideline:** Describe the specific type and characteristics of the room within the dungeon. Include details about its size, purpose, and distinctive features to set the scene for what the players are encountering.
   - **Examples:**
     - "You enter the Alchemy Lab, a spacious room filled with bubbling potions and intricate apparatuses."
     - "The Sanctum is a serene chapel, its high ceilings adorned with stained glass windows depicting celestial scenes."
     - "This Armory is a well-organized space, with racks of weapons and armor neatly arranged along the walls."

2. **Sentence 2: Atmospheric Details**
   - **Guideline:** Focus on sensory experiences specific to the room. Describe smells, lighting, sounds, or any atmospheric element that adds depth to the roomâ€™s character.
   - **Examples:**
     - "The air is thick with the scent of herbs and the faint aroma of burning candles."
     - "Dim, flickering light from enchanted lanterns casts long shadows across the stone floor."
     - "A gentle hum of magical energy resonates throughout the chamber, creating an otherworldly ambiance."

3. **Sentence 3: Unique Features**
   - **Guideline:** Highlight unique, non-interactive elements that make the room special. These can be architectural, artistic, or natural details that contribute to the ambiance without being directly usable by the players.
   - **Examples:**
     - "An ornate chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its crystals shimmering with a faint magical glow."
     - "Intricate mosaics depicting ancient symbols cover the walls, their colors vibrant despite the room's age."
     - "A large, enchanted mirror stands against one wall, reflecting not just the room but glimpses of other realms."

4. **Sentence 4: Interactive Element**
   - **Guideline:** Introduce one feature in the room that players can interact with. These should be elements that can provoke action, conversation, or decision-making. This will be expanded upon further in interactive_element_description **DO NOT MENTION TRAPS OR ANYTHING HIDDEN TO PLAYERS.**
   - **Examples:**
     - "A large, ancient tome rests open on a pedestal, its pages filled with indecipherable symbols."
     - "A mystical orb floats in the center of the room, pulsating with vibrant light."
     - "A sturdy door made of reinforced steel stands at the far end, adorned with intricate carvings."

**Return the description in JSON format with the following keys:**

- **name**: A short, appropriate name for the room (e.g., "Alchemy Lab", "Sanctum", "Armory"). This name should be 1-2 words and should be simple, indicating the function of the room.
- **one_sentence_summary**: A brief summary of the room's function or purpose within the dungeon.
- **lore_description**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe the room's history, purpose, and how it fits into the dungeon's lore. Who uses or used this room, and for what specific activities?
- **features_and_contents**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe notable features, items, or information present in the room that may be of interest to the players.
- **interactive_element_header**: A brief header for the interactive element in the room (e.g., "The Ancient Tome", "The Mystical Orb", "The Reinforced Door").
- **interactive_element_lore**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Provide additional lore or context about the interactive element. Why is it here? What is its significance?
- **interactive_element_details**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Describe the interactive element in more detail, including its appearance, behavior, and any effects it may have on the players. Are there any skill checks or actions required to interact with it? What benefits or consequences might arise from interacting with it?
- **read_aloud_description**: A vivid description to read aloud when players enter the room, following the sentence-by-sentence guidelines above. Remember to take the following short description into account, particularly when it comes to room size: ${shortDescription}
- **additional_notes**: For the Dungeon Master's eyes only. Include any other relevant information or secrets about the room.
